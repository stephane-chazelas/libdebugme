# What is this?

It may occasionally be hard to run failing program under debugger
e.g. if it runs inside deeply nested build system.

This project solves this by providing a library (libdebugme.so)
which can be linked or even preloaded to system to catch signals
and automatically run gdb (or, in future, any other debugger).

The project is BSD-licensed. It has no fancy dependencies,
just Glibc and GDB.

# Usage

Disclaimer: I have _not_ yet seriously tested this although
it seems to work robustly on Ubuntu 14.04 and Fedora 22.

Simply preload libdebugme.so to process and ask it to intercept
"bad" events:
```
DEBUGME_OPTIONS=handle_signals=1 LD_PRELOAD=libdebugme.so make
```
and it'll automatically run gdb on error.

Alternatively you can manually link your app against libdebugme
(but beware of --as-needed which is enabled by default in modern
distros and will drop library dependency unless you call it
explicitly) and/or run debugger explicitly (public APIs are
in debugme.h).

Available runtime options:
* xterm - run debugger in a separate xterm
* handle\_signals - attach debugger on all bad signals
  (SIGSEGV, SIGILL, etc.)
* debug - print diagnostic info
* debug\_opts - additional options to pass to debugger.
  Note: the debugger command line, including those options is
  interpreted by $SHELL (typically your login shell).

# Future plans

Here're some plans for libdebugme:
* ensure thread and signal safety
* support other debuggers (gdbserver, ddd, lldb, Visual Studio, etc.)
* use CMake
* other minor TODO/FIXME are scattered all over the codebase
